# MoreLockBlocks

clearly the world needs more lock blocks

## Features

This mod currently adds:

- Dream Lock Block

  An inactive dream block that can be unlocked to become active.

- Glass Lock Block

  A Lock Block version of vanilla's Glass Block. Allows visual customizability via the Glass Lock Block Controller.

- Glass Lock Block Controller

  Allows per-room customization of the visuals of Glass Lock Blocks.

All lock blocks have customizable lock sprites and unlock sounds, and are compatible with both vanilla and Dzhake Helper keys (though you can customize which of these and which Dzhake Helper key groups work per block). Compatibility with other mods' key types (such as Crystalline Keyberries) is not guaranteed.

## Feedback / bug reports / feature requests

Please reach out to me (@aonkeeper4) in Celestecord if you have any feedback / bug reports / feature requests, however this is kind of a thing I made on a whim to see if I could so things might take a while. Basically the only reason I'm making the 1.0 release now is because uhh i got bored of waiting for ideass and i need more things im kinda proud of on my gb account
